# test_code_atomic_measurement

This blood pressure monitor application is a reference implementation of Atomic Measurement, a key feature supported by OCF healthcare Device Types.
- OCF: https://openconnectivity.org/

It is an APPLICATION-level code which uses and is built on top of IoTivity 1.3.1.
- IoTivity: https://iotivity.org/

This code passes all Atomic Measurement Test Cases (CT1.2.15 ~ CT1.2.20).

OS: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

## Installation Guide
1. Create a folder under the same path with IoTivity 1.3.1. (App: /home/hongki/test_code_atomic_measurement, IoTivity: /home/hongki/iotivity)
2. Clone or copy files of this repository to the created folder
3. Type ./start.sh to build and run the app
4. If CTT prompts "Please initiate device to revert to read for OTM", replace server.dat with RFOTM/server.dat
